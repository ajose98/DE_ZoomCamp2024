# DE_ZoomCamp2024

This repository will store the main files created throughout the [Data Engineering ZoomCamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp), delivered by [DataTalksClub](http://datatalks.club). I am doing it in a self-paced mode.

This is a 10-week deep dive into data engineering, with hands-on learning, practical assignments and a final project. It is composed by a collection of videos that introduce some of the most used technologies for Data Engineering nowadays and guide us on how to use and perform tasks in these technologies. Some of the technologies covered are **Google Cloud Platform, Terraform, Docker, Big Query, dbt, Spark, SQL and Kafka**.

There will be two folders in this repository: CourseModules and FinalProject (not initiated yet). 

* In the CourseModules you will find the code files created while solving each of the modules and a folder called "Homework" that will store my code for the homework solution of the current module.
  
<ins>When Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is used in the course, I followed the steps using GCP but afterwards I tried to find out how to do the exact same thing but using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**</ins>. The files for AWS end with "_AWS", while the files used for GCP end with "_GCP".
* In the FinalProject you will find all the information and code on the final project.
