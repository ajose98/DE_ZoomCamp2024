# DE_ZoomCamp2024

This repository will store all the files created throughout the Data Engineering ZoomCamp course, delivered by @DataTalksClub. I am doing it in a self-paced mode.

This is a very practical course which is composed by a collection of videos that introduce some of the most used technologies for Data Engineering nowadays. It includes step by step videos on how to use and perform tasks in these technologies and has homeworks at the end of each chapter to test what was learnt. Some of the technologies covered are **Google Cloud Platform, Terraform, Docker, Big Query, dbt, Spark, SQL and Kafka**.

There are three folders in this repository: CourseChapters, Homeworks and FinalProject. 

* In the CourseChapters you will find all the files created when solving each of the chapters.
  
<ins>When Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is used in the course, I decided to follow the steps using GCP but afterwards I went to find out how to do the exact same thing but using Amazon Web Services (AWS)</ins>. Both solutions can be found in the folder mentioned above. The files for AWS end with "_AWS", while the files used for GCP end with "_GCP".
* In the Homeworks folder you will find the solution of the homeworks that exist at the end of each chapter.
* In the FinalProject you will find all the information and code on the final project.
