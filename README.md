There are three folders: Homeworks, CourseChapters and FinalProject. 

* In the Homeworks folder you will find the resolution of the homeworks that exist at the end of each chapter.
* In the CourseFiles you will find all the files created when solving each of the chapters.
* In the FinalProject you will find all the information and code on the final project.
